Using a lentiviral shRNA library targeting approximately 16\hspace{0.167em}000 human genes and a newly developed scoring approach, we identified essential gene profiles in more than 70 breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines. We developed a web-accessible database system for capturing information from each step in our standardized screening pipeline and a gene-centric search tool for exploring shRNA activities within a given cell line or across multiple cell lines. The database consists of a laboratory information and management system for tracking each step of a pooled shRNA screen as well as a web interface for querying and visualization of shRNA and gene-level performance across multiple cancer cell lines.

  abstract = {Genomic analyses are yielding a host of new information on the multiple genetic abnormalities associated with specific types of cancer. A comprehensive description of cancer-associated genetic abnormalities can improve our ability to classify tumors into clinically relevant subgroups and, on occasion, identify mutant genes that drive the cancer phenotype (``drivers''). More often, though, the functional significance of cancer-associated mutations is difficult to discern. Genome-wide pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens enable global identification of the genes essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation, providing a ``functional genomic'' map of human cancer to complement genomic studies. Using a lentiviral shRNA library targeting \ensuremath{\sim}16,000 genes and a newly developed, dynamic scoring approach, we identified essential gene profiles in 72 breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer cell lines. Integrating our results with current and future genomic data should facilitate the systematic identification of drivers, unanticipated synthetic lethal relationships, and functional vulnerabilities of these tumor types.
Significance: This study presents a resource of genome-scale, pooled shRNA screens for 72 breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer cell lines that will serve as a functional complement to genomics data, facilitate construction of essential gene profiles, help uncover synthetic lethal relationships, and identify uncharacterized genetic vulnerabilities in these tumor types.

  abstract = {Summary
Proteomics has proved invaluable in generating large-scale quantitative data; however, the development of systems approaches for examining the proteome in vivo has lagged behind. To evaluate protein abundance and localization on a proteome scale, we exploited the yeast GFP-fusion collection in a pipeline combining automated genetics, high-throughput microscopy, and computational feature analysis. We developed an ensemble of binary classifiers to generate localization data from single-cell measurements and constructed maps of ∼3,000 proteins connected to 16 localization classes. To survey proteome dynamics in response to different chemical and genetic stimuli, we measure proteome-wide abundance and localization and identified changes over time. We analyzed \&gt;20 million cells to identify dynamic proteins that redistribute among multiple localizations in hydroxyurea, rapamycin, and in an rpd3Δ background. Because our localization and abundance data are quantitative, they provide the opportunity for many types of comparative studies, single cell analyses, modeling, and prediction.

  abstract = {Changes in protein subcellular localization and abundance are central to biological regulation in eukaryotic cells. Quantitative measures of protein dynamics in vivo are therefore highly useful for elucidating specific regulatory pathways. Using a combinatorial approach of yeast synthetic genetic array technology, high-content screening, and machine learning classifiers, we developed an automated platform to characterize protein localization and abundance patterns from images of log phase cells from the open-reading frame-green fluorescent protein collection in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each protein, we produced quantitative profiles of localization scores for 16 subcellular compartments at single-cell resolution to trace proteome-wide relocalization in conditions over time. We generated a collection of \ensuremath{\sim}300,000 micrographs, comprising more than 20 million cells and \ensuremath{\sim}9 billion quantitative measurements. The images depict the localization and abundance dynamics of more than 4000 proteins under two chemical treatments and in a selected mutant background. Here, we describe CYCLoPs (Collection of Yeast Cells Localization Patterns), a web database resource that provides a central platform for housing and analyzing our yeast proteome dynamics datasets at the single cell level. CYCLoPs version 1.0 is available at http://cyclops.ccbr.utoronto.ca. CYCLoPs will provide a valuable resource for the yeast and eukaryotic cell biology communities and will be updated as new experiments become available.},
